Let's evaluate the expressions one by one:

1. (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
   The expression (5 > 4) is true because 5 is indeed greater than 4.
   The expression (3 == 5) is false because 3 is not equal to 5.
   Therefore, the overall expression is false, since both conditions connected by "and" need to be true for the entire expression to be true.

   Value: false

2. not (5 > 4)
   The expression (5 > 4) is true because 5 is greater than 4.
   The "not" operator negates the value, so the result is the opposite.
   Therefore, the overall expression is false.

   Value: false

3. (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
   The expression (5 > 4) is true because 5 is greater than 4.
   The expression (3 == 5) is false because 3 is not equal to 5.
   Since it's an "or" operator, only one of the conditions needs to be true for the entire expression to be true.
   Therefore, the overall expression is true.

   Value: true

4. not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
   The expression (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) is true because (5 > 4) is true.
   The "not" operator negates the value, so the result is the opposite.
   Therefore, the overall expression is false.

   Value: false

5. (True and True) and (True == False)
   The expression (True and True) is true because both operands are true.
   The expression (True == False) is false because True is not equal to False.
   Since it's an "and" operator, both conditions need to be true for the entire expression to be true.
   Therefore, the overall expression is false.

   Value: false

6. (not False) or (not True)
   The expression (not False) is true because False is negated.
   The expression (not True) is false because True is negated.
   Since it's an "or" operator, only one of the conditions needs to be true for the entire expression to be true.
   Therefore, the overall expression is true.

   Value: true

To summarize, the values of the given expressions are:
1. (5 > 4) and (3 == 5): false
2. not (5 > 4): false
3. (5 > 4) or (3 == 5): true
4. not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)): false
5. (True and True) and (True == False): false
6. (not False) or (not True): true
